[OpenAI.fm](https://openai.fm) is an interactive demo to showcase the new OpenAI text-to-speech models.
It is built with NextJS and the [Speech API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech).

For more information about text-to-speech using the OpenAI API, check out our [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech).

## How to run

1. **Set up the OpenAI API:**

   - If you're new to the OpenAI API, [sign up for an account](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
   - Follow the [Quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to retrieve your API key.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-fm.git
   ```

3. **Set the OpenAI API key:**

   2 options:

   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable [globally in your system](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries#create-and-export-an-api-key)
   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in the project: Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following line (see `.env.example` for reference):

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   Run in the project root:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **(Optional) Connect to a hosted database:**

   If you want to use the sharing feature, you need to connect to a hosted postgres database.
   You should set the environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of the project to connect to your database as shown in `.env.example`.

   ```bash
   POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name"
   ```

   This step is not needed to run the application and only affects the sharing feature.

6. **Configure Amazon Cognito:**

   The application uses Amazon Cognito for authentication. Copy `.env.example`
   to `.env` and fill in your user pool details:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=<YOUR_USER_POOL_ID>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_REGION=<YOUR_AWS_REGION>
   NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_DOMAIN=<YOUR_COGNITO_DOMAIN>
   ```

   Ensure your app client allows `http://localhost:3000/callback` as a callback
   URL and `http://localhost:3000/signout` as a logout URL and includes the
   `openid` and `email` scopes.

7. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
   Visit [`/login`](http://localhost:3000/login) to sign in with Cognito.
